    "Introduction to PyMC\n",
    "\n",
    "While Markov chain Monte Carlo is a powerful method for fitting Bayesian models, they can be difficult to apply generally, as most commercial statistical analysis packages do not implement it. This has been an impediment to the growth of Bayesian methods. PyMC is a python module that implements Bayesian statistical models and fitting algorithms, including MCMC. Its flexibility and extensibility make it applicable to a large suite of problems. Along with core sampling functionality, PyMC includes methods for summarizing output, plotting, goodness-of-fit and convergence diagnostics.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyMC 2.3 provides functionalities to make Bayesian analysis as painless as possible. Here is a short list of some of its features:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Fits Bayesian statistical models with Markov chain Monte Carlo and other algorithms.\n",
    "    Includes a large suite of well-documented statistical distributions.\n",
    "    Uses NumPy for numerics wherever possible.\n",
    "    Includes a module for modeling Gaussian processes.\n",
    "    Sampling loops can be paused and tuned manually, or saved and restarted later.\n",
    "    Creates summaries including tables and plots.\n",
    "    Traces can be saved to the disk as plain text, Python pickles, SQLite or MySQL database, or hdf5 archives.\n",
    "    Several convergence diagnostics are available.\n",
    "    Extensible: easily incorporates custom step methods and unusual probability distributions.\n",
    "    MCMC loops can be embedded in larger programs, and results can be analyzed with the full power of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dig into PyMC in detail, let's look at a simple hierachical linear model of a house's price as a function of age, to give you a flavor for what Bayesian models look like when implemented in PyMC. "
